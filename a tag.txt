HTML(Hyper Text Markup Language) is one of the languages we use to create web applications. It adds structure to your web pages.

HTML has various tags we use to create elements. And multiple elements come together to create meaningful web pages and applications.

The anchor tag is one of the most used and well-known tags in HTML. In this article, we will learn about the anchor tag () and its main uses with many examples.

But why talk about the anchor tag if it is already well-known? There are a few essential details of this tag that many devs don't know - but they should. So let's learn them.

I have created an app to demonstrate different behaviors of the anchor tag. You can check it out and use it as you read this article.
What is the Anchor Tag in HTML?
The primary purpose of an anchor tag is to link one page to another page or to a section of the same page. The anchor tag is also known as a HyperLink. Like any other HTML tags, you use the following construct to create an anchor tag:

<a>My Website</a>

The above anchor tag is a valid HTML tag, but it doesn't do much other than act as a placeholder. Let's use this anchor tag to link to a web page. You need to use the href attribute to link to another page.

<a href="https://Cloudeflex.com">My Website</a>

The value of the href attribute is usually a URL pointing to a web page (like the one above). You can also link another HTML element or a protocol (for example, sending email), and you can execute JavaScript using the href attribute. We will see the examples of how to do all this below.

Anchor Tag Uses with Examples
Along with href, there are other vital attributes that make the anchor tag useful. Let's learn about them with examples.

How to link to a section of the page
We have seen how to link to an external web page (website). But you can also link to a section of the same page by linking to an element using its id. Assume our page has a div section with the id news.

<div id="news">
    <h2>News</h2>
    <p>
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
        Sed non risus. Suspendisse lectus tortor, dignissim sit amet,
        adipiscing nec, ultricies sed, dolor. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, 
        consectetur adipiscing elit.
    </p>
</div>

You can now link to this section (div) using the anchor tag. To do that, just use the id of the section with a # as the prefix for the href value.

<a href="#news">Go</a>

So, when you click on the Go link, you will scroll to the news section of the page.
How to link to an email client
You may need to open the default email client with the email address when users click on a link. You can do this by using the mailto protocol as the href attribute's value. The syntax of the value should be in the form of mailto:<email address>.

<a href="mailto:me@example.com">Send email</a>
Now clicking on the Send email link will open up the default email client on your operating system with the email address (me@example.com) specified in the TO field.

Similarly, you can use the tel:<Phone Number> construct to open up the default phone app with the phone number when someone clicks on the link.

<a href="tel:+914123456765">Call +914123456765</a>
How to link to a script and execute it
You can link to JavaScript code and execute it when someone clicks on the link. You shouldn't do this often, as it is always a better practice to rely on event handlers to execute actions rather than linking them. But let's learn this method too.

<a href="javascript:alert('Hello World!')">Click me</a>
Now if you click on the Click me link, you will see a browser alert with the text, Hello World! in it.

How to download a file
The anchor tag has the download attribute that turns a regular link into a download link. You can download a file by clicking the link. It opens up the download popup to save the file on the device.

<a href="./images/rajni.jpg" download="Thalaiva">Download</a>

You can optionally specify a custom file name by assigning the name to the download attribute. There is no need to specify the file extension while specifying the custom name. It will be added automatically depending on the file extension you are trying to download.

Note that this functionality works only if the file is of the same origin. The file you are downloading must be located under the same site where the link is added.

How to open a page in a new window/tab
You may not want your users to get distracted too much from what they are doing when clicking on a link. You may want to open the page in a new browser window/tab when the user clicks on the link on a current page. We can use the target attribute for this purpose.

<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank">Click Me</a>
The target attribute can have the following values,

_blank: this is the most used option. You can open the linked page on a new window/tab by setting the target attribute value as _blank.
_self: this is the default value. It helps open the linked page in the same window frame.
_top: this opens the linked page in the top window.
_parent: this opens the linked page in the parent frame.
We will see how to use the last two values when we discuss the link with frames in a while.

Anchor Link and Tabnabbing
Tabnabbing is a type of Cybersecurity attack where the attacker takes advantage of the user moving away from the current page and introduces a Phishing attack.

Assume you are browsing a website and click on a link to open the page in a new tab/window (remember target=_blank?). Now the attacker gets ahold of the window object of the browser and manipulates (redirects) the source page to a look-alike website with a few changes to trap you.

Those few changes could be a login form where you accidentally provide your credentials, and the attacker wins. This is called Tabnabbing.

To protect users from an attack like Tabnabbing, you need to pass a couple of values to an anchor tag's rel attribute:

noopener: makes the opening browser context unknown by setting the window.opener object as null. This means that the attacker doesn't have any way to redirect the source page.
noreferrer: this makes sure that referrer header will not be included when the link is clicked. You must set this value for older browsers.
So, the more secure way to use the target=_blank value is with the rel attribute, like this:

<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
How to link with frames and child pages
You can include another HTML document on the current page using the <iframe> tag.

<iframe src="./child-frame.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>
Then the chlid-frame.html may have another iframe to include another HTML document.

<div class="child-frame">
  I am the Child frame.
  <iframe src="./grand-child-frame.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>
Now how do you link to the parent frame from the grand-child.html page? Also, how do you link to the top-most window frame?

<li>
    <a href="https://example.com" target="_parent">Opens in the parent frame(target: _parent)</a>
    <a href="https://example.com" target="_top ">Opens in full body of the window(target: _top)</a>
</li>
As the code above shows, we use the target as _parent to link to the parent frame. The target value _top links to the window frame.

How to ping in the background
You may want to track how many clicks a particular link is getting on your website. To do that, you can use the ping attribute of the anchor tag.

A ping attribute accepts one or more URLs as values. When someone clicks on the link, it makes a tiny POST request on those URLs. If there are multiple URLs, they must be comma-separated.

<a href="https://example.com" ping="https://example.com/tracking">With a Ping</a>
How to Style an Anchor Tag
The anchor tag has states. The default state is called link. The other three states are:

hover: An anchor has this state when a user mouses over it.
active: An anchor has this state when a user clicks on the link.
visited: A visited state means a user has already clicked the anchor link.
You may get confused with the differences between the active and visited states at times. The active state is brief. It activates just when the user clicks on a link, and then the state changes to the visited state.

CSS has pseudo-classes to apply styles for a specific state. The pseudo-classes are preceded by a colon (:) symbol and added after a selector. So, for the anchor tag(), we can style it for all the states we have seen above.

a:link: the same as applying styles to the a tag directly.
a:hover: applies styles when the user mouses over the anchor.
a:active: applies styles when a user activates the link by clicking on it.
a:visited: apples styles when the state changes to visited.
Below is an example of applying different colors for every state of the anchor tag:

a:link {
    color: #ff3e00;
}

a:hover {
    color: #ffee00;
}

a:active {
    color: #d900ff;
}

a:visited {
    color: #51ff00;
}
You can apply any style of your choice based on these state changes.

Don't Confuse the Anchor Tag with the Link Tag
You may sometimes confuse the anchor tag with the link () tag. We use the link tag to link to external resources like stylesheets, favicon, fonts, and so on.

<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Quicksand:wght@300;400;500&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

<link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">

<link rel="icon" href="./images/fav.ico">
We have already learned that the primary purpose of the anchor () tag is to link one HTML page to another. Moreover, it is a hyperlink that you can click on to get to the target document.

HTML Attributes
HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.

HTML Attributes
All HTML elements can have attributes
Attributes provide additional information about elements
Attributes are always specified in the start tag
Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"
The href Attribute
The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specifies the URL of the page the link goes to:

Example
<a href="https://www.Cloudeflex.com">Visit Cloudeflex</a>
You will learn more about links in our HTML Links chapter.

The src Attribute
The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed:

Example
<img src="img_girl.jpg">
There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src="https://www.Cloudeflex.com/images/img_girl.jpg".

Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed.

2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg".

Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain.

The width and height Attributes
The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels):

Example
<img src="img_girl.jpg" width="500" height="600">
The alt Attribute
The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader.

Example
<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">
Example
See what happens if we try to display an image that does not exist:

<img src="img_typo.jpg" alt="Girl with a jacket">
You will learn more about images in our HTML Images chapter.

The style Attribute
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more.

Example
<p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>
You will learn more about styles in our HTML Styles chapter.

The lang Attribute
You should always include the lang attribute inside the <html> tag, to declare the language of the Web page. This is meant to assist search engines and browsers.

The following example specifies English as the language:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
...
</body>
</html>
Country codes can also be added to the language code in the lang attribute. So, the first two characters define the language of the HTML page, and the last two characters define the country.

The following example specifies English as the language and United States as the country:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
<body>
...
</body>
</html>
You can see all the language codes in our HTML Language Code Reference.

The title Attribute
The title attribute defines some extra information about an element.

The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element:

Example
<p title="I'm a tooltip">This is a paragraph.</p>
We Suggest: Always Use Lowercase Attributes
The HTML standard does not require lowercase attribute names.

The title attribute (and all other attributes) can be written with uppercase or lowercase like title or TITLE.

However, Cloudeflex recommends lowercase attributes in HTML, and demands lowercase attributes for stricter document types like XHTML.

At W3Schools we always use lowercase attribute names.

We Suggest: Always Quote Attribute Values
The HTML standard does not require quotes around attribute values.

However, W3C recommends quotes in HTML, and demands quotes for stricter document types like XHTML.

Good:

Bad:
<a href=https://www.Cloudeflex.com/html/>Visit our HTML tutorial</a>
Sometimes you have to use quotes. This example will not display the title attribute correctly, because it contains a space:

Example
<p title=Description of Cloudeflex>
 we always use quotes around attribute values.

Single or Double Quotes?
Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used.

In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes:

<p title='John "ShotGun" Nelson'>
Or vice versa:

<p title="John 'ShotGun' Nelson">
